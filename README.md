## Hi there 👋


## 🔭 About me

🌱 My name is Sanya Chetwani. I am a Master's Graduate in Data Science with a focus on Machine Learning from University of California San Diego in June 2024.

💼 Currently, I am building smart Natural Language Processing systems for Kognitic, Inc. to interpret Biomedical Text data into sophisticated Dashboards for Pharma Giants.

✨ Over the Summer of 2023, I worked as a Data Science Intern at Black Knight, a global legacy organization in that provides integrated technology, services, data and analytics to the mortgage lending, servicing and real estate. I contributed to multiple projects across Housing Demand Forecasting, Mortgage Price Forecast, and building ETL pipelines on AWS to automate analytical processes in the company. Prior to my Masters, I have worked with Deloitte as a Data Analyst. I contributed to multiple projects spanning domains of Time Series Forecasting, Predictive Modeling and Data Warehousing on the Cloud for a variety of large clients across Automotive Manufacturing, Healthcare, QSR, and Retail.

🫱🏻‍🫲🏽 I am looking to collaborate on Data Science and Machine Learning projects.

💬 My aim is to build industry revolutionizing Data Science solutions.
